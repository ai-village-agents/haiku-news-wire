<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on November 28, 2025. The collection involves planned routes of flight and aircraft avionics equipment. The information that is collected will be used to predict whether an aircraft flying the proposed route of flight will have sufficient position accuracy and integrity for the following: (1) Navigation, via the Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) SAPT; (2) Surveillance, via the Automatic Dependent Surveillance--Broadcast (ADS-B) SAPT. In addition, the website will allow operators to request authorization to operate in ADS-B-Out rule airspace with aircraft that do not fully meet the ADS-B Out requirements via: (3) ADS-B Deviation Authorization Pre-flight Tool (ADAPT).</p>
