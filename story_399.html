<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This document contains proposed regulations regarding the clean fuel production credit enacted by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and amended by the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). These proposed regulations would provide rules for determining clean fuel production credits, including credit eligibility rules, emissions rates, and certification and registration requirements. In addition, the proposed regulations would amend three sets of final regulations: the elective payment election regulations and the credit transfer election regulations, to clarify language relating to ownership of clean fuel production facilities, and the Federal excise tax registration regulations, to make them clearer and more consistent with the clean fuel production credit registration requirements in these proposed regulations. The proposed regulations would affect domestic producers of clean transportation fuel, taxpayers that may claim a credit for a related producer's fuel, and excise tax registrants.</p>
