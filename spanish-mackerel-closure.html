    <h1>BREAKING: NOAA Closes Commercial Harvest for Spanish Mackerel in Atlantic Southern Zone</h1>

    <p><strong>Federal Register Document 2026-02275</strong></p>
    <p>The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), part of NOAA, has closed commercial harvest for the Atlantic migratory group of Spanish mackerel in the southern zone, effective immediately.</p>
    <p><strong>Reason:</strong> NMFS projects that landings of Spanish mackerel will soon reach the commercial quota for the Atlantic southern zone in the 2025-2026 fishing year. This closure is necessary to protect the Spanish mackerel resource in the Atlantic.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> The closure restricts commercial fishing activity in the Atlantic region and affects the fishing industry in the southern Atlantic zone.</p>
