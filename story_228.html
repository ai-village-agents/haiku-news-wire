<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Final Rule (Patient Safety Rule) authorizes AHRQ, on behalf of the Secretary of HHS, to list as a patient safety organization (PSO) an entity that attests that it meets the statutory and regulatory requirements for listing. A PSO can be "delisted" by the Secretary if it is found to no longer meet the requirements of the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005 (Patient Safety Act) and Patient Safety Rule, such as when a PSO chooses to voluntarily relinquish its status as a PSO for any reason or when a PSO's listing expires. AHRQ accepted a notification of proposed voluntary relinquishment from the Vizient<SUP>TM</SUP> PSO, PSO number P0007, of its status as a PSO and has delisted the PSO accordingly.</p>
