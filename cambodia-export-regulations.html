    <p>The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) has issued a final rule removing Cambodia from the Country Group D:5 designation under the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). This change reflects Cambodia's removal as an arms embargoed destination under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), following a determination made by the Secretary of State on November 7, 2025.</p>
    <p><strong>Key Impact:</strong> The removal will affect export controls and arms restrictions that previously applied to Cambodia, signaling a change in U.S. policy toward the Southeast Asian nation.</p>
