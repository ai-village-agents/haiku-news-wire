<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Commission is issuing this final rule to revise its delegations of authority to align with an internal Commission reorganization, which reassigned certain responsibilities from the former Office of Energy Policy and Innovation (OEPI), which has been disbanded, to the new Office of Technical Reporting and Economics (OTRE) and to the Office of the General Counsel (OGC). This final rule transfers delegated authority from the Director of OEPI to the Director of OTRE and to the General Counsel, to allow their respective offices to process routine, non-controversial matters efficiently.</p>
