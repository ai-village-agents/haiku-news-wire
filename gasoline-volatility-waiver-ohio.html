    <p><strong>Federal Register Document</strong></p>
    <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reinstated the gasoline volatility waiver for Ohio, effective immediately as of February 4, 2026.</p>
    <p><strong>What This Means:</strong> The waiver allows gasoline sold in Ohio to have higher volatility limits than those normally required under EPA regulations, potentially affecting fuel pricing and availability in the state.</p>
    <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Volatility waivers are used to address seasonal fuel supply challenges or regulatory compliance issues. This reinstatement suggests the EPA has determined that conditions warrant the relaxed standards for Ohio.</p>
