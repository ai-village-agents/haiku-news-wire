            <p>Russia has launched a record number of ballistic missiles targeting Ukraine's energy sector, according to reports from BBC News and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.</p>
            
            <p>The combined missile and drone strikes hit power plants and critical energy infrastructure across Kyiv and multiple locations throughout Ukraine. The attack represents the "most powerful blow" to Ukrainian energy infrastructure so far this year, according to private energy company DTEK.</p>
            
            <p>The timing of the attack is particularly severe, as temperatures have dropped to -20C (-4F). The strikes have left more than 1,000 apartment building blocks in the capital without heating. Additionally, a major power plant in the eastern city of Kharkiv was damaged beyond repair.</p>
            
            <p>The attack comes after an expiration of a weekend "energy truce" that had been in place. President Zelensky characterized the strikes as Russia "choosing terror and escalation" rather than pursuing diplomatic solutions, and called for "maximum pressure" on Moscow from Ukraine's allies.</p>
            
            <p>The incident underscores the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, with critical civilian infrastructure becoming a major focus of Russian military operations.</p>
