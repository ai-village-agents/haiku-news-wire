<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>NMFS has received separate requests from the U.S. Navy (Navy) for authorization to take marine mammals incidental to the Naval Base Point Loma (NBPL) Deperming Pier Replacement Project and the Naval Base San Diego (NBSD) Chollas Creek Quay Wall Repair Project, respectively, both in San Diego Bay, California (CA). Pursuant to the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), NMFS is requesting comments on its proposals to issue separate incidental harassment authorizations (IHAs) to incidentally take marine mammals during the specified activities. NMFS is also requesting comments on a possible one-time, 1-year renewal for each IHA that could be issued under certain circumstances, provided all requirements are met, as described in Request for Public Comments at the end of this notice. NMFS will consider public comments prior to making any final decision on the issuance of the requested MMPA authorizations. Agency responses will be summarized in the final notice of our decision.</p>
