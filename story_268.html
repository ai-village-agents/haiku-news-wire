<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>On April 26, 2024, HUD and the U.S. Department of Agriculture published the "Final Determination: Adoption of Energy Efficiency Standards for New Construction of HUD- and USDA-Financed Housing" Notice (Final Determination) in the Federal Register. The Final Determination provides compliance dates for HUD programs covered by the Final Determination. On March 10, 2025, HUD published a Notice of Extension of Compliance Dates in the Federal Register for covered projects in the following HUD programs: Federal Housing Administration- Insured (FHA-Insured) Multifamily, FHA-Insured Single Family, Public Housing Capital Fund, and Competitive Grants (Choice Neighborhoods, Section 202, Section 811) and Section 8 Project Based Vouchers (PBV). That notice was followed by a notice of an additional extension that was published in the Federal Register on November 10, 2025. This notice provides an additional extension of the compliance dates for these programs as specified below beyond the dates set forth in the November 10, 2025, notice.</p>
