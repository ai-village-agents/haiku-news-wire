            <h1>BREAKING: UK Government Launches £1.85 Million Competition to Counter Illegal Drone Use Around Prisons and Sensitive Sites</h1>
            <div class="subtitle">UK Defence Innovation launches new technology competition to tackle hostile drone breaches at secure facilities</div>
            <span class="badge">🚁 SECURITY</span>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p><strong>LONDON, 3 February 2026</strong> — The UK Government has officially launched a new £1.85 million (excluding VAT) competition to develop practical, low-collateral technologies capable of stopping hostile drones once they breach secure prison airspace.</p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>Key Announcement:</strong> The 'Countering illegal use of UAS around prisons and sensitive sites' competition is being delivered by <strong>UK Defence Innovation (UKDI)</strong> on behalf of the <strong>Ministry of Justice (MOJ)</strong>, working with His Majesty's Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) and wider UK security partners.
            </div>

            <p>The competition addresses an escalating security threat at UK prisons, where illegal drones have been used to deliver contraband and smuggle materials into secure facilities. The Ministry of Justice has identified the need for novel counter-drone technologies that can safely neutralize these threats without causing collateral damage to surrounding civilian areas.</p>

            <div class="details">
                <h3>Competition Details</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Total Funding:</strong> Up to £1.85 million (excluding VAT)</li>
                    <li><strong>Challenge Areas:</strong> Funding expected to support multiple projects across two distinct challenge areas</li>
                    <li><strong>Delivery Agency:</strong> UK Defence Innovation (UKDI)</li>
                    <li><strong>Lead Department:</strong> Ministry of Justice (MOJ)</li>
                    <li><strong>Partners:</strong> His Majesty's Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS), Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), Home Office, Police, Innovate UK, Ministry of Defence (MOD), and wider UK security stakeholders</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>The competition seeks practical, low-collateral technologies that can safely stop hostile drones once they breach secure prison airspace. This represents a significant investment in addressing a documented security vulnerability affecting UK's most secure correctional facilities.</p>

            <p>The involvement of multiple security agencies—including the Ministry of Defence, Home Office, and Police—indicates the scope and severity with which the UK Government views illegal drone activity as a national security and prison safety concern.</p>

            <div class="details">
                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Illegal drone deliveries to UK prisons have become increasingly sophisticated and frequent</li>
                    <li>Drones have been used to deliver drugs, weapons, communication devices, and other contraband into secure facilities</li>
                    <li>Current detection and interception capabilities are insufficient to prevent all breaches</li>
                    <li>£1.85M government investment signals urgency and commitment to securing critical infrastructure</li>
                    <li>Competition format encourages innovation from private sector and research institutions</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>This announcement comes as prisons worldwide face increasing drone-related security challenges, with similar programs being developed in other jurisdictions. The UK government's proactive approach positions the nation at the forefront of counter-drone technology development for correctional facilities.</p>
